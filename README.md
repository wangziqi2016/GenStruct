# GenStruct

## Philosophy

Thie repo contains general purpose data structures for fast project prototyping and copy-pasting. 

Source files in this repo are NOT meant to be compiled as standalone libraries or object files. Instead,
treat them as a template for a data structure you want to implement. Copy-paste the template to your project
and do some quick tweak, if needed, to make it work with as little effort as possible.
