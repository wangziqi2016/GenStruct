# GenStruct

## Philosophy

Thie repo contains general purpose data structures for fast project prototyping and copy-pasting. 

Source files in this repo are NOT meant to be compiled as standalone libraries or object files. Instead,
treat them as a template for a data structure you want to implement. Copy-paste the template to your project
and do some quick tweak, if needed, to make it work with as little effort as possible.

Source files in this repo are NOT meant to be super fast, highly optimized, coded with high-IQ language hacks,
showing off personal skills, etc. Expect only ordinary and canonical stuff. 
Coding principles and standards for readability, however, are fully imposed and carried out throughout the entire repo.
In fact, the motivation of opening this repo is simply because I no longer want to reinvent the wheel for each new
project I started. I will also keep this repo constantly updated as soon as I reinvented another wheel.
